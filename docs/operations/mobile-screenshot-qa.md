# Mobile screenshot QA harness

> For maintainers. Using T3 Code? See [docs/user](../user/).

The screenshot harness runs the real mobile application against three disposable local T3
environments. It creates an isolated base directory and server for each environment, real Git
projects with deterministic content, seeded orchestration projections, and persisted terminal
history. The app pairs with every server through its normal connection flow and React Navigation
opens the production Home, Thread, ThreadTerminal, ThreadReview, and SettingsEnvironments routes.

No screenshot-specific screen recreates application UI. `EXPO_PUBLIC_SHOWCASE=1` only enables the
non-rendering pairing/readiness coordinator, disables terminal autofocus so captures do not contain
the software keyboard, and supplies deterministic discovery rows to the real
Environments screen. The local environment cards always come from real paired servers.

## Capture the default matrix

From the repository root:

    pnpm screenshots:mobile

The command:

1. Creates three temporary T3 base directories and starts a local server for each on an available
   port.
2. Creates T3 Code, React, and Linux Git repositories with recognizable favicons, feature branches,
   and a deterministic T3 Code review diff.
3. Seeds each server's migrated SQLite database with playful threads, messages, activities, and
   terminal history, then adds two persisted mobile-outbox tasks waiting to send.
4. Starts an isolated Metro server, builds the selected native apps, and boots each device.
5. Pairs each clean app installation with Moonbase Terminal, Suspense Station, and Kernel Cabin.
6. Navigates to the real application route for every requested scene.
7. Sets the requested system appearance and palette, normalizes status bars, converts captures to 24-bit RGB PNGs without alpha, and
   validates dimensions, aspect ratio, file size, and screenshot count before succeeding.
8. Writes the captures beneath the configured output directory for local inspection and
   manual QA or bug reports.

The servers, Metro, temporary root directory, and devices started by the runner are cleaned up after
capture. Pass `--keep-running` to retain them for inspection; the runner prints the base-directory
paths and server ports.

Captures wait for the real environment snapshot to hydrate and for the requested route to become
active. Both platforms record readiness in the simulator/emulator app container. A final settle
delay allows native terminal and Git review data to finish rendering.

A full capture regenerates the selected native project with Expo's clean production prebuild before
building it. Use --skip-build for repeated captures after the first build.

The harness uses fixed Metro port `8199`, which separates it from Expo's normal default port but is
shared across every checkout. The readiness check only verifies that the port is open; it does not
verify process ownership. Concurrent screenshot harnesses in different worktrees can therefore
collide or attach to the wrong Metro process.

Every configured device defaults to dark appearance and the `t3-code` palette, so plain
`pnpm screenshots:mobile` produces 30 dark PNGs. Pass `--appearance light`, `--appearance dark`, or
`--appearance both` to override the configured appearance; `both` produces 60 PNGs.

Pass `--theme <id>` (repeatable) or `--theme all` to capture the app's other palettes: `t3-code`,
`t3-chat`, `grove`, `ocean`, `ember`, and `iris`. The runner hands the palette to the app as a launch
argument, the app applies it to both color schemes, and a scene only reports itself ready once the
requested palette is active — so a capture can never show the previous theme. `--theme all`
multiplies the run by six; only the native build is shared.

The default matrix is:

| Platform | Capture target            | Viewport  | Local QA focus              |
| -------- | ------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------- |
| iOS      | iPhone 17 Pro Max         | 1320×2868 | Phone layout and safe areas |
| iOS      | disposable iPhone 14 Plus | 1284×2778 | Smaller phone layout        |
| iOS      | iPad Pro 13-inch (M5)     | 2752×2064 | Landscape and tablet layout |
| Android  | Pixel AVD at 420 dpi      | 1080×1920 | Phone layout and density    |
| Android  | Pixel AVD at 600dp width  | 1080×1920 | Medium tablet layout        |
| Android  | Pixel AVD at 800dp width  | 1440×2560 | Large tablet layout         |

Each target captures thread, terminal, review, thread list, and environments. Each
appearance and theme gets its own leaf folder, making it straightforward to compare
the same route across devices without mixing unrelated captures. The exact output
directory and device subdirectories are configured in
[mobile-showcase.config.ts](../../scripts/mobile-showcase.config.ts).

A light-only run writes the same tree under `light/`; `--appearance both` writes both appearance
folders, and each requested theme adds a sibling folder next to `t3-code/`.

Edit [mobile-showcase.config.ts](../../scripts/mobile-showcase.config.ts) to change simulator or AVD
names, light/dark appearance, default palette, iOS orientation, scenes, output directory, capture
delay, Android ABI, or viewport. The selectable palette ids come from `MOBILE_THEME_IDS` in
[themePalettes.ts](../../packages/shared/src/themePalettes.ts), so the harness and the app's
appearance settings can never drift apart.

## Fast iteration

Capture one scene or device:

    pnpm screenshots:mobile --device iphone-6.9 --scene thread
    pnpm screenshots:mobile --platform android --scene review

Override the configured appearance or capture both variants:

    pnpm screenshots:mobile --appearance light
    pnpm screenshots:mobile --appearance dark
    pnpm screenshots:mobile --appearance both

Capture other palettes:

    pnpm screenshots:mobile --device iphone-6.9 --theme ocean
    pnpm screenshots:mobile --device iphone-6.9 --theme ocean --theme ember
    pnpm screenshots:mobile --device iphone-6.9 --theme all

Reuse the native build and retain the disposable environment:

    pnpm screenshots:mobile --device ipad-13 --skip-build --keep-running

By default, let the screenshot runner start Metro on port `8199`. To keep Metro in a separate
terminal, start it with the same showcase environment and explicit harness port:

    cd apps/mobile
    APP_VARIANT=development EXPO_PUBLIC_SHOWCASE=1 pnpm exec expo start --dev-client --port 8199

Then run the capture from the repository root:

    pnpm screenshots:mobile --skip-build --skip-metro --device iphone-6.9

`pnpm --filter @t3tools/mobile showcase` starts Expo on its normal port, so it is not compatible with
the harness's `--skip-metro` mode.

List the matrix and flags:

    pnpm screenshots:mobile --list

Validate existing files without starting Metro, servers, simulators, or emulators:

    pnpm screenshots:mobile --validate-only
    pnpm screenshots:mobile --platform ios --validate-only

## Customize the seeded environment

- Project repository, thread projections, conversation, terminal transcript, and Git changes:
  [mobile-showcase-environment.ts](../../scripts/mobile-showcase-environment.ts)
- Device and capture matrix:
  [mobile-showcase.config.ts](../../scripts/mobile-showcase.config.ts)
- Simulator/emulator orchestration:
  [mobile-showcase.ts](../../scripts/mobile-showcase.ts)

Fixture timestamps are generated relative to capture startup so every route shows stable relative
labels while the server still receives valid current data. The same deterministic three-environment
ensemble serves iPhone, iPad, Android phone, and Android tablet captures; responsive differences
come entirely from the production app layout.

The Pending rows use the production offline outbox and point at the real T3 Code and React fixture
projects. Showcase coordination holds those two entries in the outbox for capture, just like a task
currently open for editing, so reconnecting the seeded environments cannot deliver and remove them
before the screenshot is taken.

The Environments capture presents the three local fixture transports as a Tailscale HTTPS hostname,
a Helsinki VPS hostname, and a Tailnet IPv4 address. This display-only substitution keeps the cards
remote-first while the harness retains reliable loopback connections to its ephemeral servers.

## Local prerequisites

- iOS: Xcode command-line tools, the configured simulator runtimes, and installed CocoaPods.
- Android: SDK resolution checks `ANDROID_HOME`, then `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`, then defaults to
  `$HOME/Library/Android/sdk` on macOS or `$HOME/Android/Sdk` on other platforms. The resolved SDK
  must provide `adb` and `emulator`, and the configured AVD must exist.

The harness validates the configured viewport dimensions; do not resize its output before
inspection. If local device targets change, update the target specification. Capture fails
when a PNG has the wrong size, has alpha, is not 8-bit RGB, exceeds the configured file-size
limit, violates the target aspect-ratio bounds, or leaves an output set missing a requested scene.
