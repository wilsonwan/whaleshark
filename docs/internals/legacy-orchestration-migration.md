# Legacy orchestration migration

Orchestration v2 imports v1 threads in place. It creates v2 thread shell events first and imports
the complete user and assistant transcript lazily when a client reads or continues the thread. The
v1 projection tables remain the import source and provide a read-only recovery source if an import
needs investigation.

## Imported data

The shell import preserves the project and thread identifiers, title, provider and model selection,
runtime and interaction modes, branch, worktree path, creation and update times, archive and delete
times, settlement override and timestamps, snooze timestamps, pin timestamp and order, and linked
pull request. The metadata repair path fills snooze, pin order, `unsettledAt`, and linked pull request
fields for threads imported before those fields were covered.

Transcript import reads user and assistant rows from `projection_thread_messages`. It preserves
message identifiers, text, supported attachments, timestamps, role, and ordering. A message that was
still streaming becomes an interrupted turn item.

The importer does not translate provider session identity, native provider runs, checkpoints and
diffs, activities and tool calls, approvals, or proposed plans. V2 therefore must not present those
records as migrated history.

## First continuation

A migrated thread has no active provider thread. Its first continuation creates a fresh provider
session and sends a legacy handoff built only from user and assistant messages. The handoff selects
the newest transcript suffix within a 32,000-character budget, including section labels and the
import notice. This budget is separate from portable provider handoffs.

## Recovery

There is no supported whole-thread export API. Recovery uses an untouched copy of the environment's
`userdata` directory and opens that copy with SQLite's read-only mode. The user guide documents the
queries against `projection_threads` and `projection_thread_messages`. Never start a server against
the recovery copy because startup can run migrations and write new state.
